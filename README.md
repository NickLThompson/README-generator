## Description

This program is designed to create a very quick but efficient

README markdown document. It includes a place for the user to

input a title, description, installation process, choose a

license, list contributors, type any questions, how to test

the code, and a place to put the user's github username and email


## Usage

It's extremely easy to use and very useful. Anybody who needs a 

readme document for just about anything can use this program.

## Status

The status of this program is a complete success! I started my 

coding journey in Java, so working exclusively in the terminal

is nothing new to me. I found it not only less daunting than

previous projects, but also pretty satisfying; Customizing the 

terminal font and colors is a whole rabbit hole to go down.
